    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> I am working towards being able to get a job. 
      The experiences that led me here is my mom and dad being responsible and going to work everyday, meeting new people, expanding their horizons. 
      I am working towards these goals by learning how to be responsible, be able to communicate with other people, not the same people I talk to everyday.
      The values that I consider necessary for my success is to have respect, honesty, passion, integrity. My short term goals are for me to be able to work for one of my family members so I can get some practice.
      Another could be for me to be on a sports team so that I can learn to meet new people and talk to them, I could learn responsibility by showing up to practice and making every game. 
      I want to be known for my passion that I have in my job, that I can be honest with people. I want people to know that I am compassionate about my job, and the things I know I am able to do.
